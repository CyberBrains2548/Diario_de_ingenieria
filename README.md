The cart we are developing is an autonomous system designed to detect and avoid objects based on their color. It consists of several components integrated with an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which orchestrates the operation of each part of the system. The main components and their functions are described below, as well as their relationship with the vehicle's electromechanical components and the process for building, compiling, and uploading the code to the vehicle controllers.
Components and Their Functions:
H-Bridge L298N: This component is crucial for controlling the DC motor of the cart. It is programmed to vary the speed of the cart, allowing it to accelerate or decelerate as needed to avoid obstacles. The H-Bridge works as a bidirectional switch that can change the polarity of the electric current sent to the motor, allowing the motor to rotate in both directions. This is essential for the cart's ability to move forward and backward, as well as to perform precise evasive maneuvers.
Servomotor MG996R: This servomotor is responsible for controlling the direction of the front wheels of the cart. By using certain angles, the servomotor can steer the wheels to the right, left, or keep them in a central position, facilitating the cart's change of direction. The MG996R is known for its high precision and torque capability, making it ideal for steering control applications in small vehicles. The servomotor is controlled by PWM (pulse width modulation) signals generated by the Arduino.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Three ultrasonic sensors have been integrated into the cart. These sensors are responsible for detecting the presence of objects in the path of the cart. They work by emitting high-frequency sound waves and measuring the time it takes to receive the echo after it reflects off an object. Based on this time, the sensor can calculate the distance to the object. When an object is detected, the system is programmed to stop the cart and analyze the situation, ensuring that the cart can safely maneuver around the obstacle.
GY-31 Color Sensor: This sensor is vital for the cart's ability to avoid objects based on their color. The color sensor can identify the color of obstacles by using an RGB LED and a photodiode that measures the intensity of light reflected at different wavelengths. This allows the cart to make informed decisions about which side to pass to effectively avoid the obstacle.
Relationship with the Vehicle's Electromechanical Components:
The H-Bridge L298N, the MG996R servomotor, the ultrasonic sensors, and the GY-31 color sensor work together to provide the cart with advanced navigation and obstacle detection capabilities. The interaction between these electromechanical and electronic components is orchestrated by the Arduino Uno, which acts as the brain of the system.
The H-Bridge and the DC motor are directly connected to the rear wheels of the cart, providing the necessary propulsion. The MG996R servomotor is connected to the front wheels and controls the direction of the cart. The ultrasonic sensors are strategically positioned at the front and sides of the cart to provide 360-degree detection coverage. The GY-31 color sensor is mounted in a position that allows it to scan obstacles in the cart's path.
Process for Building, Compiling, and Uploading the Code:
The process for building, compiling, and uploading the code to the vehicle controllers involves several detailed steps:
1.	Circuit Design: Start with designing the electrical circuit, ensuring that all components are correctly connected to the Arduino Uno. This includes connecting the H-Bridge to the Arduino control pins, the servomotor to a PWM pin, and the ultrasonic sensors and color sensor to the corresponding digital and analog pins.
2.	Writing the Code: The next step is writing the code in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The code must include the necessary libraries to control each component, as well as functions to read data from the sensors, process this information, and send commands to the actuators (H-Bridge and servomotor). The code should also implement the navigation algorithm that allows the cart to detect and avoid objects based on their color.
3.	Compilation: Once the code is written, it is compiled in the Arduino IDE to check for any syntax or compilation errors. Compilation converts the source code into a binary file that can be uploaded to the microcontroller.
4.	Uploading the Code: After a successful compilation, the binary code is uploaded to the Arduino Uno via a USB cable. The Arduino IDE includes tools to upload the code and monitor the microcontroller's output in real-time.
5.	Testing and Adjustments: With the code uploaded to the Arduino, tests are conducted to ensure that all components work correctly. This may include testing the cart's movement, obstacle detection, and response to different object colors. If issues are found, adjustments are made to the code or the circuit design.
Conclusion:
The design of our autonomous cart combines various technologies and electromechanical components to create a system capable of navigating safely and efficiently, avoiding obstacles based on their color. The integration of an H-Bridge, servomotor, ultrasonic sensors, and a color sensor, all controlled by an Arduino Uno, allows for complex and precise interaction between software and hardware. The process of building, compiling, and uploading the code to the controllers is essential to ensure the correct functioning of the system, and is carefully carried out to ensure that all parts work in harmony.
